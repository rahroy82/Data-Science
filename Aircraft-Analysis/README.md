# Aircraft-analysis

# Project Goal
This project is aimed towards the analysis of aircrafts risk assessment, by manufacturer and model.

### Data source and Data Exploration
The data used in this project has been sourced from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

Assessing the risk of aircrafts for the sole purpose of expanding our business portfolio. This expansion will allow us to cut external cost of logistics for our current commercial and private enterprise businesses. This expansion also includes the transportation of our corporate personnel.
  
  We are mainly concerned with the safety and risk of each type of aircraft, therefore we analyzed the risk based on category of aircraft, usecase, make, model and survival rate of passengers.
  
  Out of all types of aircrafts available in the dataset, we chose to use the airplane aircraft. The dataset has data which dates back over 60 years, we decided to use only the latest 20 years of data. This prevented the inclusion of airplanes that are just to old and would not give us a present and modern result of existing airplanes. 
  
  In conclusion, our analysis filtered out that the best feature and combinations of airplanes that carries low risk to passengers and destruction of airplanes, are those that are dual engines, jet propulsion and specific types of makes and models.
